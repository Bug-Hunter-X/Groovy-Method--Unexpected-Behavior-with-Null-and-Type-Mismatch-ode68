# Groovy Method: Unexpected Behavior with Null and Type Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common Groovy pitfall: unexpected behavior when dealing with null values and type mismatches in method parameters. Groovy's dynamic typing offers flexibility, but it can lead to runtime errors if not handled correctly.

The `bug.groovy` file contains a method that incorrectly handles null or incompatible type inputs. The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a corrected version that addresses these issues using type checking and appropriate exception handling.
